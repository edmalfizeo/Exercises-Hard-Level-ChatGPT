Prime Factorization:
Write a Python function to find all prime factors of a given number.

Palindrome Check:
Write a Python function to check if a given string is a palindrome or not. (Without using built-in string reversal functions)

Matrix Transposition:
Write a Python program to transpose a given matrix (2D list).

Word Frequency Counter:
